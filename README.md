## Description

This repo contains a collection of tools that I have developed for my own convenience. 
They are based on the Django framework and various Python libraries.

The repo is deployed on _Liara_ platform, but it may not be always accessible because I switch it off to save costs.

The tools are made to my specific needs, so they may **not** be very useful for others. 
However, feel free to browse and give feedback.
